Creating social network web application for my final project on college. I used WAMPP technology stack. This is my first project based on PHP language and I am pretty satisfied. I partly followed instructions from Microsoft SE (Reece Kenney) course on Udemy.

This app allows users to create posts and add new friends, message with others, change profile settings, like and comment on posts and a lot of more. I wanted to create app that is similar to Facebook. In next months I will try to improve app by adding new functionalities like playing games or post images and videos on profile page.
